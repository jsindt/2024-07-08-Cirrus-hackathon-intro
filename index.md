<h2>Description</h2>

This lesson provides an introduction to using Cirrus for users who:
  - have already used other HPC systems; and
  - want to use pre-installed simulation/modelling packages rather than compiling their own.

The lesson aims to answer the following questions:
  - What hardware is available on Cirrus?
    + What does it consist of (login nodes, compute nodes, file systems, backup)?
    + How does this impact me as a user?
  - How can I access Cirrus interactively and transfer data?
  - What does the Cirrus software environment look like and how do I access software?
  - How do I write job submission scripts and submit them to the Cirrus scheduler?
  - How can I be a good Cirrus citizen?
  - How can I check what resources I am using and look at historical usage?
  - What are the next steps for me using Cirrus and how can I get more help?

> You should have used remote HPC facilities before. In particular, you should be happy with connecting
> using SSH, know what a batch scheduling system is and be familiar with using the Linux command line.
> You should also be happy editing plain text files in a remote terminal (or, alternatively, editing them
> on your local system and copying them to the remote HPC system using `scp`).
